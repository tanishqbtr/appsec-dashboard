3. **Build Failures**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and TypeScript errors resolved
4. **Permission Errors**: Verify user roles and admin permissions for protected operations

### Development Tips
- Use `npm run check` to verify TypeScript compilation before deployment
- Run `npm run db:push` after schema changes to sync database
- Check browser console for client-side errors and network tab for API issues
- Monitor server logs for authentication and database connectivity issues
